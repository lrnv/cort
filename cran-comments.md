#> * checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
#> Maintainer: 'Oskar Laverny '
#> Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
#> Laverny (10:602)
#> Rulli√®re (10:641)

This two words are well-spelled names of authors from a cited paper in the Description field, so the note is irrelevant. However, i did not found out how to get rid of this note.
