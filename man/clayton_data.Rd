clayton_data
}
\description{
This dataset is a simulation of 200 points from a 3-dimensional clayton copula with \eqn{\theta = 7},
hence highly dependent, for the first, third and fourth marginals. The second marginal is added
as independent uniform draws. Lastly, the third marginal is flipped,
inducing a negative dependence structure.
}
\details{
This dataset is studied in O. Laverny, V. Maume-Deschamps, E. Masiello and D. Rulli√®re (2020).
