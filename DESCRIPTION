Description: Provides S4 classes and functions to fit several copula models, mainly empirical ones or non-parametrical. The classical Checkerboard copula are implemented, with an option to make the checkerboard parameter vary by dimension. A version of this checkerboard allows for prior knowledge of several multivariate margins of the model, and construct the rest of the copula with a special type of checkerboards. Furthermore, we provide an efficient way to produce mixture of copula classes. We also implemented a generic way of measuring d-dimensional boxes with a copula. Finaly, we provide an implementation of the full CORT estimator (including the localised dimension reduction procedure), and we propose a bagging mechanisme for this model.
