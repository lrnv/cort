Description: Provides S4 classes and methods to fit several copula models: The classic empirical checkerboard copula and the empirical checkerboard copula with known margins are proposed. These two models allow to fit high-dimensionals copulas with a small number of observations, and they are always proper copulas. Some flexibility is added in the parametrisation via a possibility to differentiate the chceckerboard parameter by dimension. The last model consist of the implementation of the Cort algorithm, including the localised dimension reduction, which fits a copula by recursive partitionning of the unit hypercube. We also provide an efficient way of mixing copulas, allowing to bagg the Cort algorithm into a forest, and a generic way of measuring d-dimensional boxes with a copula.
